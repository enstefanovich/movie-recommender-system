# movie-recommender-system
This is a group project I participated in for a machine learning class I took for my graduate degree.
I worked on it in Spring 2025.
It uses the same data as my TMDB-R-project work, but with additional user movie review data.
The goal of this project was to build a recommender system that could ask a user for their ratings of a sample of movies, compare the user to other users in the data we used, and find and recommend movies from our movie data that they might like based on user and movie similarities.
The recommender model uses KNN with cosine similarity to find related users and movies.

The movie data comes from: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata/data

The movie user review data comes from: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/parasharmanas/movie-recommendation-system/data
